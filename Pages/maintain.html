                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. 
                It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
                making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,
                 looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through 
                 the cites of the word in classical literature, 
                 discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum 
                 et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
                  of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", 
                  comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

                Nowadays, too many people are out of shape. In fact, obesity is 
                (as of right now) one of the most severe public health issues 
                facing the country. An astonishing number of people eat too much,
                 exercise too little and don’t take their fitness seriously.
                  As physical therapists, we’re always looking to instill a
                   desire for bodily health in our patients. Of course, with
                    such busy schedules and so many obligations, it’s easy for
                     us to neglect our physical fitness.

            <p> 
                There are numerous ways to lose weight, 
                skipping rope is one of the effective methods for it. 
                However, skipping rope alone is not enough to lose weight
                 but also it requires a planned diet, weight loss goals,
                  commitment, and high activity level. You also need to 
                  consider some other factors like age, previous illnesses/
                   surgeries before starting exercise as it may affect your
                    rate of weight loss.

                 If you jump rope for 30 minutes to one hour daily you will
                  lose almost 200-300

                It makes your abdominal muscle core go through a full range of motion,
                 causing your spine to both stretch and contract thus making them stronger
                  and preventing your back from arching at the same time. 
                  The movement created by the abs roller wheel provides a huge challenge
                   to your rectus abdominus, the six-pack muscles

                Want to reduce the risk of heart disease by almost half? 
                 A five-minute run every day is what stands between you 
                 and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Research 
                 shows that runners have a 27% lower risk of early death
                  and a 30% lower risk of death from cardiovascular problems. 
                   This is true for all runners, no matter how fast they run or
                    for how long.

                By all accounts, running helps you stay healthier and live longer.  
               What's not to like?

            <p>
                Exercise helps you lose the weight now and keep it off forever, 
                burning calories while building lean muscle mass. 
                And since muscle requires energy for maintenance,
                 your resting metabolic rate will rise. For optimal results,
                  aim for 150 to 300 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity, 
                  such as speed walking or cycling on even terrain. 
                  Or, get 75 to 150 minutes a week of vigorous exercise such as
                   running or jumping rope. In addition to aerobic exercise, 
                   perform resistance training at least twice weekly, 
                targeting all the major muscle groups. Lifting weights or 
                performing body-weight exercises such as pushups and crunches
                 qualifies as resistance training.

                Caloric Restriction
                Caloric restriction involves cutting your normal daily calories by 20 to 40 percent.
               Doing so may provide health benefits including lowering your risk for age-related 
               conditions like diabetes, memory problems, cancer and heart disease, according to
               a study published in "Science" in July 2009. Restricting calories in elderly 
                individuals for 3 months resulted in improved scores on verbal memory tests,
                 according to another study published in January 2009 in the "Proceedings of the
                 National Academy of Sciences."
